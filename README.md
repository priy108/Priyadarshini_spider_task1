spider task 1

Common tasks:
1) application development :
   I have created a hammer strength game containing both single player and two player options.
   The file myweb.html is the main page from which one can play the singleplayer mode or two player mode.
   The files singleplayer.html amd twoplayer.html are singleplayer mode and twoplayer mode repectively.
   The person who is playing the game can stop the hammer and restart the game by clicking the respective buttons.
   (Download all the image files so that you can view the images in the gameplay)
flaw:
   (In the multiplayer mode clicking the restart/player-2 button before clicking the stop button leads to undesired output)

2) Cybersecurity :
   I have created a pdf file
