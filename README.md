spider task 1

Common tasks:
1) application development :
   I have created a hammer strength game containing both single player and two player options.
   The file myweb.html is the main page from which one can play the singleplayer mode or two player mode.
   The files singleplayer.html amd twoplayer.html are singleplayer mode and twoplayer mode repectively.
   The person who is playing the game can stop the hammer and restart the game by clicking the respective buttons.
   (Download all the image files so that you can view the images in the gameplay)
flaw:
   (In the multiplayer mode clicking the restart/player-2 button before clicking the stop button leads to undesired output)

2) Cybersecurity :
   I have created a pdf file which consists of the publically availabe links by using google dorking. I have did the same for 4 different sites (Telsa, NASA, Openai, Netflix)
   The links are of the below mentioned catogories:
            1)Files
            2)Login/admin pages
            3)Backups
            4)Emails and contacts 
            5)Errors
            6)Git and env
   3) UI/UX :
      I have designed a landing page of a cafe which provides description of the cafe, product showcase and customer testimonials by using Figma.
      The link of my figma file has been attached inside the text file (The text file contains link of the file and the prototype link).

   Domain specific:
   UI/UX :
   I have designed the page of the jewellery brand Pandora. It consists of moodboard, user-journey, wireframes and mockups. It provides description, contacts, product           showcase, location of few stores and a cart and favourites page.
